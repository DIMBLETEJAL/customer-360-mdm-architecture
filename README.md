# Customer 360 / Master Data Management Architecture

This repository showcases an enterprise-grade Customer 360 / MDM
data architecture focused on canonical modeling, governance,
and architectural trade-offs.

## Business Problem
Customer data is fragmented across CRM, ERP, support, and marketing systems,
resulting in duplicate records, inconsistent reporting, and compliance risks.

## Objective
Design a centralized Customer 360 platform that:
- Establishes a single source of truth
- Creates a golden customer record
- Supports analytics and reporting
- Ensures governance and compliance

## Scope
This is an architecture-focused portfolio.
It emphasizes system design, data modeling,
and decision-making rather than implementation.

## Contents
- Architecture diagrams
- Data models
- Governance documentation
- Architecture Decision Records (ADR)
